Welcome to DATTEBAYO!

Unlike what the name might suggest, this is not a Naruto fan project. DATTEBAYO
is a helps you do 127.0.0.1 things. Unleashes Super-Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan if 
the superuser does it. Believe it!

Components:
-----------
[!] A CLI + TUI for the application itself.
[!] Local DNS server: DNS server that resolves all requests for a "local domain".
[ ] Domain Manager: Frontend + API for adding, removing, and managing DNS records.
[ ] Mail Server: Local mail server which can be used to send and receive emails.
[ ] Mail Admin: A Frontend to manage mailboxes, aliases, and other mail server settings.
[ ] WebMail: Webmail client to view and send emails among the "local domains".


> Definition: "Local Domain"
----------------------------
This project uses the term "local domain" to refer to a domain that is not an
actual domain on the internet. It is a domain that is only resolvable within
the local network. For example, `example.local` is a local domain. It is not
resolvable on the internet, but it can be resolved within the local network
if the local DNS server is running.

Following domains are considered "local domains", out of the box:
    ao, ara, epic, fuck, internal, ki, local, localhost, lore, mail, mi, myth,
    neko, os, pwn, root, test, thc, waifu

> Configuration
---------------
The configuration file is located at `~/.dattebayo/config.toml`. The configuration
file is in TOML format. The following is an example configuration file:

# Dattebayo Configuration File
# Superuser credentials
# superuser:
#   # username of the superuser (change if needed)
#   username: username

#   # password of the superuser (change if needed)
#   password: password

# General settings
# timer before all the servers start (in seconds, default is 5)
# start_timer: 5

# DNS server settings
# dns:
#   # primary port for the DNS server (default is 53)
#   primary_port: 53
#   # fallback port for the DNS server. if primary port is in use or doesn't have privileges, the server will fall back to this port (default is 53535)
#   fallback_port: 53535

# Domain manager settings
# domain_manager:
#   # port for the domain manager server (default is 42424)
#   port: 42424

# Mail server settings
# mail:
#   # primary port for the mail server (default is 25)
#   primary_port: 25
#   # fallback port for the mail server. if primary port is in use or doesn't have privileges, the server will fall back to this port (default is 25252)
#   fallback_port: 25252
#   # port for mail server admin panel (default is 25253)
#   admin_port: 25253
#   # port for mail server webmail (default is 25254)
#   webmail_port: 25254

Configuring the DNS server:
---------------------------

Upon starting the program, the DNS server will start listening on the available
port. But the system's DNS resolver will need to be configured to use the local
DNS server. 

    > MacOS
    -------
    I have written a shell script in `scripts/create_resolver.sh` that will create
    a resolver file for each of the local domains in the `/etc/resolver` directory.

    To use the script, run the following commands:

    chmod +x scripts/create_resolver.sh
    ./scripts/create_resolver.sh

    Then you will need to restart the DNS resolver service:

    sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

* I will add instructions for other operating systems as the project progresses.
